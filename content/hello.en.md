In the age of the Internet, the development of an entrepreneurial activity that is willing to be meaningful, viable and oriented towards others can flourish with serenity through an approach that puts social communication and authentic conversations at the center of ones concerns.  
We then ask the following questions: "Why", "For whom", and finally "How".

My services, be them in the form of  **training**, **consulting**, or **co-production**, take place with the formation of an ad hoc team -french-speaking or transnational- which turns its attention to you, generally in two stages, over collaboration periods that can vary from a few days to several months, or even years if the attention remains on both sides...  
1 / A first stage to take a step back from what you are doing, through conversations and playful staging between the participants to the project;  
2 / A second stage to practice new uses and practice new tools and methodologies (mainly under Free and Open Source Licenses, for obvious reasons of autonomy for your productive energy) in order to invest with certainty in a new relationship to work, to others, to the world.
